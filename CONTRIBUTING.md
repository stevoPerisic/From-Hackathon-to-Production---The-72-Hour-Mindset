# Contributing

Thanks for contributing.

## Workflow
1. Create a branch using the naming conventions (`ch/*`, `fix/*`).
2. Keep chapter changes focused and small.
3. Run:
   - `npm ci`
   - `npm run lint:md`
4. Open a pull request and complete the PR checklist.

## Writing standards
- Follow chapter template structure from `book/_templates/chapter-template.md`.
- Include EBM mapping and practical examples.
- Keep language concrete and outcome-driven.

## Commit guidance
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Avoid mixing tooling and chapter content changes unless necessary.
