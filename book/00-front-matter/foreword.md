# Foreword

Most enterprises do not fail because their teams are incapable.
They fail because their feedback loops are too slow to compete.

Inside large organizations, effort is abundant.
Meetings are full. Backlogs are full. Roadmaps are full.
Yet production learning is sparse, and outcomes lag behind activity.
That gap between motion and measurable impact is where strategy decays.

This book addresses that gap with a clear operating discipline: the
72-hour mindset.

Its claim is direct: every team should be able to deliver a measurable,
customer-visible vertical slice within 72 hours, tied to explicit
Evidence-Based Management outcomes and validated in production telemetry.
If the work cannot be measured, the organization is performing theater.

What makes this manuscript useful is that it refuses false tradeoffs.
It does not ask you to choose between governance and speed, or between
architecture quality and delivery cadence.
Instead, it lays out a practical system that combines EBM, DORA and flow
metrics, CI/CD and progressive delivery, team topology, Communities of
Practice, and AI augmentation with guardrails.

That combination matters.
In isolation, each discipline improves a local function.
Integrated, they become an enterprise execution model.

You will find here a bias for vertical slices over component milestones,
for hypothesis-driven funding over backlog inflation, and for weekly
measure-and-decide loops over quarterly opinion cycles.
You will also find a critical point often ignored in transformation
programs: simplification is not a side activity. It is a core strategy
for increasing time-to-market and ability to innovate.

This is not a book about adopting a framework by name.
It is a book about restoring delivery truth.
The truth that matters is visible in production:
- Did value reach customers?
- Did reliability hold?
- Did the signal improve a key value area?
- Should we scale, iterate, simplify, or stop?

For leaders, this provides a sharper way to allocate investment.
For engineering and product teams, it provides a tighter cadence for
learning.
For organizations operating at the scale of 12 to 16 Scrum teams, it
provides a practical way to move faster without losing control.

The pages ahead are meant to be used, not admired.
Apply the model in small increments.
Instrument aggressively.
Stop work that does not move metrics.
Scale what proves value.

That is the promise of the 72-hour mindset:
startup-level learning speed with enterprise-grade rigor.
