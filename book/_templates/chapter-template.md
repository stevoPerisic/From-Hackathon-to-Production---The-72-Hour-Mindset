## A quick story (real or composite)
A concrete scenario: what happened, what changed, what measurable outcome improved.

## The framework
### The 72-Hour Lens
- **Hypothesis:**  
- **Smallest vertical slice:**  
- **Measure:**  
- **Decision:** pivot / persevere / stop

> Add a simple diagram in `book/assets/diagrams/` and reference it here.

## What good looks like
- Observable behaviors
- Team patterns
- Leadership signals

## Common failure modes
- Anti-patterns
- Why they happen
- How to counter them

## EBM + DORA mapping
- **Unrealized Value:** …
- **Current Value:** …
- **Time-to-Market:** …
- **Ability to Innovate:** …
- **DORA signals:** …

## AI augmentation (practical)
